# Metaphor-Detection_vua-verbs
Metaphors is a form of figurative language used pervasively in our everyday lives. 

The goal in this shared task is to detect, at word level, all content-word metaphors in a given text (we will also have a separate evaluation for just the verbs, as many researchers are working specifically on verb metaphors). 

Dataset: VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus (VUA) dataset (also used in the 2018 shared task), which consists of text fragments sampled across four genres from the British National Corpus (BNC): Academic, News, Conversation, and Fiction. The data is annotated according to the MIPVU procedure as described in [Gerard Steen, Aletta Dorst, Berenike Herrmann, Anna Kaal, Tina Krennmayr, and Trijntje Pasma. 2010. A Method for Linguistic Metaphor Identification. Amsterdam: John Benjamins.]
